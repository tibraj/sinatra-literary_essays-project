LiteraryEssay.create(title: "Antigone, Dance on the Volcano and the Tragedy of Canonization", 
content: "The protagonists in Sophocles’ Antigone and Marie Vieux-Chauvet’s Dance on the Volcano 
possess qualities which work to reveal underlying relations, motives and tendencies that collapse 
surface level pretexts in their respective societies. Antigone’s conviction poses the kind of 
opposition that subverts just law as an individual’s endeavor . Minette’s virtuosic voice grants 
her special navigation within various racial groups, allowing her unusual space to observe, 
reflect, compare and refashion herself in a way that is unlike any other character in the novel. 
These separating, distinguishing platforms elevate Antigone and Minette to positions that push 
social standards to their limits and collapse the supposed line parting order from disorder. 
Their actions illuminate hidden tensions that direct attention to socioeconomic, racial and 
moral complexities that are mighty in their variance, questioning social or revolutionary ideals 
that are thought to be fundamental, solid or too overpowering to address. These developments 
usher towards the possibility or discussion of reformatting entire social institutions or 
strategies for unified group movement. Yet, Antigone and Minette’s significance and impact 
extends as far as merely being unique and astonishing social figures. The Chorus pits Antigone 
in a long line of tragic figures and reduces her actions to being the main catalyst for Creon’s 
tragedy of residing in his own free will in a world governed by divine fate. The immense beauty 
of Minette’s voice is the aspect that reaches others the farthest, not the uniquely informative 
experiences that are garnered because of her voice. Antigone and Minette are marked by others in 
the play and novel for their heightened significance during the respective works’ events, not by 
the potential they bring to address progression in their social realms after they are gone.",

LiteraryEssay.create(title: "“Fine, Solid, Dependable”: Death as Mediating Technology and the Existential in White Noise", 
content: "Technological innovation ceaselessly ushers in the kind of change that encompasses both the private and public 
realms. With each new device, medical breakthrough and enhanced news coverage, the individual’s relationship with his/her 
respective community is continuously altered. These kinds of developments influence constant changes in language, social 
standards and approaches to things that are existential or intangible. In Don Delillo’s White Noise, the institutions, 
platforms and mediums of the techno-media sphere circulate an ever growing wealth of information that isn’t as much freely 
available as it is constantly interjecting and filling the spaces of everyday life. The dominating, enduring and active 
presence of radio and television, for example, influences characters in the novel to rely on technology and media as the 
paramount source for personal assurance, well-being, certainty and self-worth. Conversations, ideas and thoughts center 
around the idea that there is a concrete answer for every problem. Jack’s confrontation with death poses as a potential 
reversal of this colonizing effect. When applying the same mentality and approach, that the source or the answer to something 
can always be reached, Jack’s expectations are always subverted. His pursuits to find out more about the nature of his 
potential death and the mystery of Dylar leave more questions than answers and reinforce his initial uncertainty and fear of 
death. Not only does death serve as a catalyst for collapsing notions of technology and media as complete and whole resources 
to abide by,  death also doubles as potential for being the very mediator through which Jack can balance consistent 
existential questions/fears with constant technological innovation and its consequent impact on society and people.",

LiteraryEssay.create(title: "Preserving Individual Potential Through Isolation in Winesburg, Ohio", 
content: "In Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, Elizabeth Willard and Louise Bentley are characters whose states of 
isolation are presented as permanent positions. Their solitude often poses as a method for reaching retrospective clarity. 
By understanding and acknowledging the regrets they have for missed and unavailable opportunities, Elizabeth and Louise offer 
a more intricate look at the flaws and complexities associated with the failure of their intimate social relationships and 
why they have doomed them. While Elizabeth and Louise accept their tragic fates, their self-exiles from everyday life present 
better opportunities for their offspring to avoid the same kind of results. Where Elizabeth and Louise rush to latch onto 
something tangible after having their complex emotions unreciprocated by others in various relationships, their isolation in 
adulthood serves as a source for George and David to achieve a moment of resonance that taps into the inexpressible quality 
of life that Elizabeth and Louise were in pursuit of. This kind of relationship ultimately steers George and David away from 
the same pitfalls.",
